    <h3>HashiCorp</h3>
    <p>HashiCorp is a unicorn company focused on building automation software for platform teams to improve developer velocity, reduce risk, and optimize efficiency. HashiCorp believes that a multi-cloud strategy is the future of infrastructure and unlocking this cloud model is key to enable success for everyone. </p>
    <p>HashiCorp is a very transparent, engineering-centric company with a key focus on the practitioner and support of OSS. The idea is to show the power of our tooling through OSS adoption and then leverage that knowledge to support companies at a later stage in their growth when they have different, larger, enterprise needs.</p>

    <h3>The problem</h3>
    <img src="img/diagram.svg" />
    <p>Prior to HashiCorp Developer existing, documentation and tutorial content was split out across 9 entirely different sites, creating a very disparate and disjointed experience for practitioners. HashiCorp believes that our products truly work better together and this experience didn’t support cross-product discovery, use-cases, or learning. All tutorials were on an entirely different site, leading to confusion as to where to go to find the content needed to solve problems or move forward in using our products. </p>
    <p>There’s a lot of overlap between reference material and tutorial content, making it very challenging to find the right content to bridge the practitioner knowledge gap. The first step in bringing clarity to this distinction is bringing the content all under the same roof. </p>

    <h3>Proposed solution</h3>
    <p>In order to meet the needs of practitioners, both current and future the documentation and tutorial content needed to be less siloed and consolidated into a singular platform. To best support multi-product use cases, product discovery and growth - they needed to all be in the same place.</p>
    <p>This space needed to be built into a content platform, and not a grouping of disjointed product-focused sites.  The experience varied a good bit across whichever site you were utilizing, so this was a good time to streamline the information architecture, content strategy and firm up on the use cases. </p>

    <h3>Navigating the known complexities and constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Every one of HashiCorp’s products is different and the majority of them have different types of users. </li>
      <li>Content for documentation and tutorials have never lived together side-by-side.</li>
      <li>The migration affected and needed to include a large number of internal stakeholders including the Education team, technical writers, developer relations among the standard product and engineering. </li>
      <li>Aggressive timelines to launch the full beta product including all content by HashiConf in October ‘22</li>
      <li>Intentional concessions needed to be identified and agreed upon in order to maintain a reasonable scope</li>
      <li>Being the first to leverage a brand new design system, Helios, that was actively in development during our build</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>Most of the initial qualitative research and understanding was done prior to my arrival at the company and project, but insights were heavily leveraged from these efforts. Throughout the project we were utilizing Maze for usability testing to identify key issues or areas for improvement in proposed solutions.</p>
    <p>HashiCorp has a fantastic ambassador program built of external resources who opt-in to allow us continuous research and interviews with actual practitioners. Through the process we were able to run concepts by members of this program to continuously validate the hypothesis we were proposing. </p>
    <p>Over and over again, the experience was highlighted as a pain point. Frequently received feedback that using our documentation usually required having multiple tabs/windows open with a lot of jumping back and forth. </p>

    <h3>How’d we do?</h3>
    <p>Metrics were a challenge initially due to trying to compare traffic across 9 sites and how that translates to effective usage of a single platform. Changing the entire structure of the product also meant there were some large SEO impacts, where we worked with an expert to help us navigate and mitigate some of the SEO hit we’d incur. </p>
    <p>Overall, we launched the product on-time for HashiConf with no issues and all products were successfully migrated in time for the product announcement. </p>
    <p>Since the migration and monitoring metrics, we’ve had some pretty nice trends across user/session count as well as traffic improvements to content sections that were previously undiscoverable. </p>
