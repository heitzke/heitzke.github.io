        <h3>About Asurion &amp; the Field App</h3>
        <p>Asurion is a bit of a quiet giant when it comes to tech companies. It's mostly commonly known as the insurance provider of mobile technology behind major US-based carriers such as AT&T and Verizon. The insurance plans are sold through the carriers, but Asurion is the company that fulfills on this service and delivers great experiences to the customers in need.</p>
        <p>This product in particular, the Field App, enables a gig-economy workforce to deliver replacement devices and sets them up for insurance subscribers in as short as just a few hours. The capabilities of this app continued to spread as other "job types" were added for this workfoce to be able to fulfill on. Some of these capabilities included major appliance repair (washers, dryers, refridgerators, etc.) and was starting to expand into some trials of automotive sevicees.</p>
